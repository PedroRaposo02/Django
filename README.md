# Django Projects

This folder contains multiple Django projects. Each project is a separate web application built using the Django framework.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the Django projects in this folder, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment (venv) to isolate the project dependencies. You can use the following command to create a venv:

  ```shell
  python -m venv myenv
  ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

  - On Windows:

    ```shell
    myenv\Scripts\activate
    ```

  - On macOS and Linux:

    ```shell
    source myenv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

  ```shell
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  This command will install all the required packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

4. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start working on the Django project of your choice.

## Project Structure

Each Django project in this folder follows a similar structure:

- `manage.py`: The command-line utility for interacting with the Django project.
- `project_name/`: The main directory of the Django project.
  - `settings.py`: The configuration file for the Django project.
  - `urls.py`: The URL configuration for the Django project.
  - `views.py`: The views (or controllers) for the Django project.
  - `models.py`: The models (or database schema) for the Django project.
  - `templates/`: The directory for storing HTML templates.
  - `static/`: The directory for storing static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.).
  - `migrations/`: The directory for storing database migration files.
